# Algorithm Solutions
A Github repository with possible optimal versions of some classical algorithms that we come across, Many a times, these techniques to make program optimal and efficient comes as handy while solving the programming challenges to overcome TLE or Memory constraints. Hope this repository helps in that case.
 
 

# Note : 

1. I am still updating the repository as and when possible, currently codes are based on classical algorithms related to array and some mathematical formulation. 
2. Planning on updating repository with more programs focusing on string manipulation and data structures, greedy approach. 

_Keen learners who are interested in for this, can visit and stay tuned with repository. 
Also feel free to work on the shortcomings to avoid tech debts. Thanks._

/*
An interval is a pair of values that represents all numbers between those two.


You are given N intervals. You need to print the farthest located interval distance that are non overlapping. If there is no non-overlapping pair of intervals present, return -1


Note: Distance between two intervals is defined by the absolute difference between the end point of the left interval and start point of the right interval.


A distance of 0 means that theyâ€™re NOT overlapping. For instance, [1, 3] and [3, 4] are not considered overlapping.

Input format
There are N+1 lines of input

First line contains a single integer N. Next N lines will contain two integers, l and r, representing the start and end point of the interval respectively.

Output format
Print the farthest distance or -1 if no overlapping intervals are present.

Sample Input 1
3

1 2

3 5

6 7

Sample Output 1
4

Explanation
The pair of intervals [1,2] & [6,7] are farthest. And the distance between them will be 6 - 2 = 4

Constraints
1<=N<=10^5

1<=l<=r<=10^6
